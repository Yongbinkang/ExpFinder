d1,"A prerequisite for using electronic health records (EHR) data within learning health-care system is an infrastructure that enables access to EHR data longitudinally for health-care analytics and real time for knowledge delivery. Herein, we share our institutional implementation of a big data-empowered clinical natural language processing (NLP) infrastructure, which not only enables healthcare analytics but also has real-time NLP processing capability."
d2,"Word embedding, where semantic and syntactic features are captured from unlabeled text data, is a basic procedure in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this paper, we first introduce the motivation and background of word embedding and its related language models."
d3,"Structural health monitoring at local and global levels using computer vision technologies has gained much attention in the structural health monitoring community in research and practice. Due to the computer vision technology application advantages such as non-contact, long distance, rapid, low cost and labor, and low interference to the daily operation of structures, it is promising to consider computer vision–structural health monitoring as a complement to the conventional structural health monitoring. This article presents a general overview of the concepts, approaches, and real-life practice of computer vision–structural health monitoring along with some relevant literature that is rapidly accumulating."
