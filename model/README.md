Due to the large size of model, you can download the SciBert model using this [link](https://github.com/allenai/scibert)

After downloading the zip file, the structure of this folder should be the same as follow:

```
|__ model/
	|__ scibert_scivocab_uncased/
		|__ config.json
		|__ pytorch_model.bin
		|__ vocab.txt
```
